        I tried for couple hours fixing it after our evaluation but the more I try to fix it, 
        the more it breaks. Lesson learned, we should use the validator whenever we apply changes - daily at least 
        so that we can catch all the bugs as we progress. Will do better next semester, learned a lot.-->

                    even when dealing with our lack of understanding on the deeper GIS services. 
                    They explained to us as much as we needed for us to be comfortable with the process and what they were doing. Thanks, G15!</p>
