        I tried for couple hours fixing it after our evaluation but the more I try to fix it, 
        the more it breaks. Lesson learned, we should use the validator whenever we apply changes - daily at least 
        so that we can catch all the bugs as we progress. Will do better next semester, learned a lot.-->

                            different data or parameters, a model is the way to go. We design custom tools...to be continued.

                        <p>Visual analysis is performed in many ways and one way that G15 specializes in is the overlaying of data 
                            layers on top of one another to see the impacts of multiple data sets more effectively on an area or to enhance a map for visual impact. 
                            With an eye for detail and analysis our Team can discern fine details and trends that impact an area and are relevant to the client's needs.</p>

                        <h3>Feature Selection and Analysis</h3>
                        <p>Data analysis is the one of the core parts of the GIS industry as it pulls out all the meaning to the 
                            terabytes of data floating around us. Here at G15 services we have systems and setups that can automatically analyze 
                            large amounts of data in a live scenario, or we can also take a more manual approach to the analysis. 
                            Complicated algorithms and a high understanding of the industry will allow us to bring levels of 
                            comprehension and insight to the data that were previously not seen or accounted for.

                        <h3>Topology Processing</h3>
                        <p>We will review, clean, and construct the topological data. Our past years of experience in the GIS industry have exposed us to many 
                            different data models and we have developed the skillsets to deal with each once and make sure the topological data is accurate and precise.

                        <h3>Data Conversion</h3>
                        <p>With the large amount of geo-graphical data at our expose, it is always wise to go for data conversion rather than recreating it. 
                            Incompatible information formats are a big issue while transferring data among different applications. With G15 conversion services, 
                            we ensure that these issues are rectified completely, and the end user gets their data into almost any software solutions.

                        <h3>Data Integration</h3>
                        <p>Our data integration services provide the interconnectivity of various systems and their data. 
                            Combined with our other services, this will ensure data gets to where it needs to and is able to traverse all systems 
                            efficiently. Automated and manual data integration services are both offered and will depend on the requirements of the 
                            business process and what would be the best solution. Integration of geoprocessing tools and processes allows for automated 
                            scripts to do analysis and changes in a secure and reliable environment.
